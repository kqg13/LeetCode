# Easy tree problem 226: Invert Binary Tree

# This problem was inspired by Max Howell, founder of Homebrew from his tweet:
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but
# you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.


# Definition for a binary tree node.

        rep = str(self.val)
        return rep

        """
        :param root: TreeNode
        :return: TreeNode
